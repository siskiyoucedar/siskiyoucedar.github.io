    "text": "I’m a PhD candidate at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, UCL.\nMy priority as an academic is to create and encourage research with application, that allows theory in geography to touch practice, and inform the way institutions, governments and social movements engage with ideas of space and place. Within this, my PhD project aims to understand how simulations from transport models are best applied to regional political contexts. My research interests sit across critical GIS, with a focus on transport justice and regional politics.\n  \nMore about me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

As a PhD candidate, I have a fair few side projects ongoing; to quote one of my interview subjects, ‘I’m dippin’ and dappin’ and I don’t know what’s happening’. You can see the repositories for those side projects on my Github, but by way of outline:\n\nSkippers - A project on how to avoid rail fares - or how to avoid people avoiding rail fares.\nGentry-fication - A project looking at the relationship between aristocratic names and the street names of the United Kingdom.\nLyric Islands - A project looking at the frequency of UK place names in song lyrics.\n\nSome of these projects are also featured in the Portfolio tab across the way.\n\n\nTalks\nLynch, C., Wood, M., Murat, T.
