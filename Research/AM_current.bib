  abstract = {WHO/UNICEF estimate 387 million people lack access to drinking water in Sub-Saharan Africa. This is the only global region where the gap is growing, being hampered by sustained non-functionality of water infrastructure. In 2015, 29\% of water points in Tanzania were non-functional. This work updates functionality estimates and uses a novel combination of global satellite data with government water point data to estimate rural population water access at a 1km resolution. The results show higher water access (58.8\%) compared to UNICEF/WHO estimates and identify non-functioning water points that will lead to the most substantial increase in population access.},
