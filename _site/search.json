Building upon this, the content focuses on advanced methodologies to extract meaning from Earth observation data and combinations of spatial data. It will examine and provide specific applied examples of achievable local, national and international policy modifications to incorporate spatial data and analytical requirements allowing data-driven optimisation of resources, maximising investment, environmental and sustainability outcomes. The module has a large practical component that is primarily taught in the R data science programming language but will briefly cover some specialist tools such as opensource geographic information systems software and cloud computing. Students will gain an operational knowledge of Earth observation data that can be drawn upon in future research or employment.

It is taught predominantly in the R data science programming language, but also covers some basic concepts in QGIS. The intention is that students will complete the course with a broad knowledge of spatial analysis which they can draw on for their dissertation and further study or employment.

It is true that, as a global norm, cities across the North and South are becoming technologically embedded via a range of digital infrastructure from mobile social media and platforms, networks of sensors, and a vast ecology of connected devices referred to as the Internet of Things. As a result, the urban has become a key site through which an incredible amount of data is produced and extracted with policymakers and politicians relying more and more on data analytics to order, pattern, and structure the complexity of urban life. A new set of programmes and practices are being put in place intent on this mode of realisation, starting with e-governance and ICT-led development schemes to the promotion of intelligent cities and smart urbanism. With sensors, dashboards, data platforms and command and control rooms, the urban is now known through data, algorithms, modelling and a combination of visual and media channels. This new urban knowledge requires specialist techniques of analysis and visualisation, one that approaches the urban as a ‘system science’.\n\n\nThis one-day workshop is open to postgraduate students across a range of disciplines from the engineering to social sciences. Led by Dr Pushpa Arabindoo and Dr Andrew Maclachlan from University College London, UK in collaboration with Dr Haripriya Narasimhan from Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, a large part of the day will be devoted to running ‘data analytic’ exercises in groups encouraging you to explore Hyderabad through a suite of dynamic, interactive and user-friendly visualisation/mapping while simultaneously reflecting on where data is collected from, how is it ‘calculated’ and ‘communicated’.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
