::: {#hero-heading}
I'm an academic in the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA), University College London (UCL).

I am driven in my career to have meaningful real world impact on the sustainability of our cities and empower students to become leading activists in urban spatial science. I take pride in my ability to explain complex problems in a simple manner, and in doing so, create an inclusive learning environment in which everyone can participate, contribute and excel.
