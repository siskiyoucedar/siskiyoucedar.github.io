Maybe you're wondering why this website is called '**siskiyoucedar**'. Long story short, in 2013 I bought a bar of soap with the same name. The syllables stuck with me, gave me a username in the age of social media, and so the beat goes on.

Not to wildly pivot from soap to political praxis, but I think the driving force of academia is to show where meaningful change should be happening and help point society in that direction. For as long as science and politics are intertwined, we have to do our best to tip the scales in favour of those who need our help the most.
