### From One Angle

My research has a broad focus. As a PhD candidate, I have a fair few side projects ongoing; to quote one of my interview subjects, '*I'm dippin' and dappin*' *and I don't know what's happening*'. You can see the repositories for those side projects on my [Github](https://github.com/siskiyoucedar), but by way of outline:

-   [**Skippers**](https://github.com/siskiyoucedar/Skippers) - A project on how to avoid rail fares - or how to avoid people avoiding rail fares.

-   [**Gentry-fication**](https://github.com/siskiyoucedar/Gentry-fication) - A project looking at the relationship between aristocratic names and the street names of the United Kingdom.

-   [**Lyric Islands**](https://github.com/siskiyoucedar/Lyric_Islands) - A project looking at the frequency of UK place names in song lyrics.

Some of these projects are also featured in the Portfolio tab across the way.
