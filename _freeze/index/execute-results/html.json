Within this, my PhD project aims to understand how simulations from transport models are best applied to regional political contexts. My research interests sit across **critical GIS**, with a focus on **transport justice** and **regional politics**.\n\n[{{< fa brands github size=lg >}}](https://github.com/siskiyoucedar) [{{< fa envelope size=lg >}}](mailto:claude.lynch.15@ucl.ac.uk) [{{< fa cloud size=lg >}}](https://claudelynch.bsky.social)\n:::\n",
