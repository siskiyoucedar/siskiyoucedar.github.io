**Module information**

Students will be required to plan the research and dissertation from an early stage with ongoing development building on both projects and taught courses developed through the year. The research topic will be defined under the guidance of the student's dissertation supervisor and with the support of the Programme Director. The aim is to produce a unique, individual piece of work with an emphasis on data collection, analysis and visualisation linked to policy and social science orientated applications.

Students may have an opportunity to collaborate with industry partners in this module.
