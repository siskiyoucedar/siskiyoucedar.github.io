Within this, my PhD project aims to understand how simulations from transport models are best applied to regional political contexts. My research interests sit across critical GIS, with a focus on transport justice and regional politics.\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

There’s a prize to be won as well for the best presentation. The session titles are:\n1. Creative approaches to transport research\n2. Current and emerging research in transport\nPlease do feel free to share this widely with any students working in the transport / mobilities space that you think might be interested.\nTo apply to either session, please submit the following information by email to the session convenors by Friday 21 February.\n\nTitle of the presentation\nAuthors, affiliations, and email addresses\nPresenter (in-person)\nAbstract (up to 300 words)\n\nSession convenors:\nClaude Lynch, UCL, claude.lynch.15@ucl.ac.uk\nLluis Martinez Ramirez, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, lluis.martinez.ramirez@vub.be\nPatrick Miner, University of Edinburgh, patrick.miner@ed.ac.uk"

    "text": "1. Creative approaches to transport research\nWe invite abstract submissions from postgraduate students for the 2025 Royal Geographical Society with IBG (RGS-IBG) Annual International Conference for the session titled “Creative approaches to transport research”. This session is sponsored by the Transport Geography Research Group (TGRG). \n\n\n\n\n\nThe session is aimed at postgraduate students conducting research in any aspect of transport geography. In the TGRG, we respond to the theme of this year’s conference by considering how transport geographers can think creatively: through creative methods, applications, or solutions in transport. Find below some suggestions for approaching this topic: \n\nArtistic and narrative techniques (e.g., storytelling, creative mapping).\nInterdisciplinary research or mixed methods.\nParticipatory and inclusive research (e.g. community engagement, citizen science).\nPossible or speculative transport futures.\nEco-centric and non-human perspectives (e.g. animal geographies, biodiversity in relation to transport).\nCritical theories of transport (rethinking theories or developing new ones).\n\nThe session also welcomes presentations in any strand of transport geography that are presented in a creative manner—for example, using multimedia or interactive elements.\nThe TGRG traditionally rewards a postgraduate prize for the best postgraduate presentation in any TGRG session at the RGS-IBG Conference. All postgraduate presentations in the “Creative approaches to transport research” session will automatically be eligible for the prize; if you do not want to be considered for the prize, please state so in your submission."
